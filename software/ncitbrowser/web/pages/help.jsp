            <b>NCI Term Browser</b> provides a consistent, user-friendly tool to browse, search and retrieve 
			all of the biomedical terminologies hosted by EVS, including both NCI 
			Thesaurus (NCIt) and the NCI Metathesaurus (NCIm), which itself includes 
			more than 70 terminologies. The 2.0 major release added support for value sets 
			(flat lists of terms from one or more terminologies used for 
			a particular coding purpose) and mappings between terminologies 
			to support data translation and cross-reference.

            the <b>Value Sets tab</b>, and the <b>Mappings tab</b>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The <b>Terminologies</b> tab allows browsing and

          </ul>

          <p>
            These 3 tabs will appear at the top of every Term Browser 
            page you are on, and the tab that is highlighted indicates 
            which section of the Term Browser you are in.  The
            <b>NCI Term Browser</b> icon above the tabs always leads 
            back to the main Terminologies home page. 
            The Term Browser and LexEVS terminology server versions 
            are displayed in the browser's home page banner; for more information on LexEVS, 
            see the <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/LexEVS/LexEVS" target="_blank">LexEVS Wiki Pages</a>.

          <p>
            The NCI Term Browser home page contains a <b>Search Box</b>
            in the upper right hand corner. This Search Box has different 
            options, and will bring back different results, depending on 
            which tab you are on in the Term Browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Several links appear below the <b>Search Box</b>.  Most 
            appear only in certain tabs or other settings, but these 
            appear on the home pages of all tabs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Sources</b> always appears at the left, and gives 
              information about all terminologies and mappings including the 
              descriptions that appear on their individual home pages.
			</li>
            <li><b>Visited Concepts</b> will appear under the Search 
              box once you start visiting individual concept pages. 
              It shows the concept name, terminology, and version for
              each concept visited, with the most recent concepts at 
              the top.</li>

            These terminologies normally represent each specific 
            meaning, such as melanoma, lung, or chemotherapy, by a 
            distinct concept with a unique, permanent code. Each 
            concept normally provides additional information such 
            as a preferred name, other terms and codes, definitions, 
            and relationships with other concepts. Concepts are 
            normally organized in parent-child hierarchies from 
            very broad top concepts down to the most specific 
            subcategories. All browsing and searching in this 
            browser reflects this concept-based view of terminology.

            The <b>Search Box</b>, in the upper right corner of the 
            Term Browser home page and of most Term Browser pages, 
            lets you enter all or part of what you are looking for 
            and how you want to search for it. Some details: 
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Text Box</b>: Enter the string of characters 
                you want to search for.
              <ul>
                <li>Search is not case sensitive (e.g., <font face="courier">aids</font>
                    will match <i>aids</i>, <i>Aids</i>, and <i>AIDS</i>).</li>
                <li>There are no wildcard characters. All characters are 
                    matched literally (e.g., searching for <b>Begins With</b>
                    <font face="courier">NAT2*</font> will match <i>NAT2*5 Allele</i>
                     but not <i>NAT2 Gene</i>).</li>
                <li>Do not use quotes - they will be searched for 
                   literally, as characters to be matched.</li>
                <li>Search multiple words requires that all search words be found in 
				    target terms.  There are two different methods used:
<ul>
<li>
	Method 1: For Exact Match and Begins With methods, and for all Property and Relationship targets, the words must be found together in the order entered with no separation.
</li>
<li>	
	Method 2: Contains search on Name, however, now looks for those words separately. A special index makes these searches faster and more flexible than before, while still ranking best matches first. Note: The current implementation only finds matches at the start of words, not the middle or end; we plan to address this in a future release.
</li>
</ul>

                   For example, if you do a <b>Contains</b> search on <font face="courier">Melanoma Cornea</font>, 
                   no results will be returned, for any option covered under Method 1,but with Method 2 
                   you will match <font face="courier"><i>Corneal Melanoma</i></font>. Refinement of these methods is ongoing. 
                </li>
		</ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Match method radio buttons</b> select how your 
                search string will be matched.
              <ul>
                <li><b>Contains</b> button is the default. 
                 It will search for what you enter at the start of any words in a Name search, or at the beginning or end of any words 
                 in a Property or Relationship search (e.g., <font face="courier">adeno</font> will match 
                 <font face="courier"><i>adenocarcinoma</i></font> in all these searches, 
                 but <font face="courier">carcinoma</font> will only match it in Property or Relationship searches). 
                 For multiple word search, see description in the preceding section. 
		</li>              
                <li><b>Exact Match</b> Only terms or codes that are identical will match.</li>
                <li><b>Begins With</b> button can be selected to find all 
                    terms that start with the words or characters 
                    you enter. Codes cannot be searched this way.</li>
                    
                <li>Concept Codes will only match if they exactly match what you enter.
                    If you select a search target of <b>Code</b> and then the <b>Begins With</b>
                    or <b>Contains</b> method button, the browser will switch 
		    to the default <b>Name</b> search target radio button.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Match target radio buttons</b> select what category 
                of concept information is searched. 
              <ul>
                <li><b>Name</b> button is the default: Search text 
                    is matched to a concept's preferred name, synonyms, or
                    acronyms. Unless stated otherwise, all 
                    search examples in this Help page use the default 
                    name search.</li>
                <li><b>Code</b> button is for searching concepts by code: Search text 
                    is matched to a concept code, or source code. The search is case-sensitive.</li>                   
                <li><b>Property</b> button will match to other direct 
                    property attributes of a concept, such as 
                    definitions.</li>
                <li><b>Relationship</b> button will return concepts 
                    that have relationships to concepts that match by 
                    name/code (e.g., an exact relationship search on

            When a terminologies search is run, <b>Search Results</b>
            are displayed by concept preferred name. If you are searching 
            multiple terminologies, a right-hand column displays the 
            corresponding name  of the terminology for each matching 
            concept. If there is only one match, the concept details 
            page is shown directly without first listing results, unless 
            the matching concept is in the NCI Metathesaurus (because 
            this links to the separate NCIm Browser). Some details: 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>All matching concepts are returned.</li>
            <li>Results are listed from best match to weakest. For 
              example, a <b>Contains</b> search on <font face="courier">Bone</font>
              returns <i>Bone</i> at the top, followed by concepts 
              with two word matches (e.g., <i>Flat Bone</i>), followed 
              by concepts whose terms have more non-<i>Bone</i> content.</li> 
            <li>When a terminology search is run, it looks for matches 
              not only in the preferred name of concepts but also among 
              the synonyms of the preferred name as listed in the concept 
              details page.  For this reason, the match will often be 
              to synonyms or codes only visible on the concept details 
              page (e.g., searching <b>Begins With</b> 
              <font face="courier">melanoma</font> will show <i>MIA</i>
              in the results list because that concept contains a 
              synonym of <i>melanoma inhibitory activity</i>.)</li> 
            <li>If there are too many to show on one page, you can page 
              through the results, with a default of 50 per page. To 
              change the default number, use the <b>Show results per page</b> 
              drop-down menu at the bottom of the results page.</li>
            <li>If a concept is retired, this will be indicated by the
              phrase "(Retired Concept") next to the name of the concept
              in the Results listing.</li>
            <li>Click on the preferred name to see a concept's details.</li>
            <li>A <b>Back to search results</b> link appears in the search 
              box when you leave the results page for other pages in the 
              Terminologies tab; click on the link to return to that last 
              results page.  If you run a new search or switch to another 
              main browser tab, that results page is lost and the link 
              disappears.

          <ul>
	    <li><b>Lucene</b>: This additional match method option is only available for Name targets,

		including wildcards, Boolean operators, negation, and fuzzy search 
		(click the radio button to see examples).</li>

              limit search to one contributing source, or stay with 
              the default of all, using the pull down menu.</li>

              terminology source, so that they can be selected and 
              searched individually or all together.  Radio buttons 
              specify whether the search expression should match 
              relationship source or target concepts (e.g., in the

              (<i>Anatomic_Structure_Is_Physical_Part_Of</i>) --&gt;

                  For NCIt concepts, role relationships are grouped by the type of concept to which the 
                  concept is related, and, for concepts that have logical models built from their 
                  inter-concept relationships, there is a separate <b>Logical Definition</b> section showing 
                  the parent concepts and direct role assertions that define that concept. 
                  Note: For some sources, the browser 
                  adds inverse relationships not asserted bidirectionally 
                  in the source data file; this is often useful for informational and 
                  navigational purposes, but is sometimes confusing, and 
                  will continue to be evaluated for adjustments in future releases.</li>

            The <b>Mappings</b> tab covers special mappings created 
            between pairs of terminologies, showing how some or all 
            concepts in the first (source) terminology can be mapped 
            to one or more concepts, with the same or related meaning, 
            in the second (target) terminology.  The Mappings tab home
            page provides a full list of mapping data sets, but for 
            now only allows searching one at a time.  To search a 
            mapping set, you have the choice of either

            If you choose to go to a particular mapping set's home
            page, you can also choose to view the full mapping set 
            (which will appear in a format described below for the 
            results of a search) by clicking on the red box called 
            <b>View Mapping</b> or by clicking on the link that says 
            <b>Mapping</b> right underneath the Search Box.

            Searching using the <b>Search Box</b> on either the <b>Mappings</b> tab or on a particular 
            Mapping Set's home page works the same way as on the <b>Terminologies</b> tab: the <b>Text Box</b>, 
            the <b>Match method radio buttons</b>, and the <b>Match target radio buttons</b> all function the same 
            way as with the <b>Terminologies</b> tab. The one difference to note is that search results 
            can come from a match to either the source or target concept in each mapping entry. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The results of the search are quite different, however, 
            because the search involves matched pairs of concepts 
            from both the source and target terminologies; search 
            hits can happen on either source or target, and what 
            comes back are the matched pairs. In order to illustrate 
            the nature and results of a search in the Mappings tab, 
            we will use a PDQ to NCIt (version 201010) mapping set 
            search for anything that contains 
            <font face="courier">"melanoma."</font> A chart appears

          <ul>
            <li><b>Source</b>: the source terminology that has been 
              mapped to a target terminology (for a PDQ to NCIt mapping, 
              for example, the <b>source</b> will always be "PDQ," 
              since PDQ is the source terminology and NCIt is the 
              target terminology).</li>
            <li><b>Source Code</b>: the concept code of a concept in 
              a source terminology (for example, the <b>source code</b>
              CDR0000038833 of the PDQ concept "melanoma" that has 
              been mapped to the target NCIt concept "Melanoma").</li>
            <li><b>Source Name</b>: the name of a concept in a source 
              terminology (for example, the PDQ concept with the 
              <b>source name</b> "melanoma" has been mapped to the 
              NCIt concept "Melanoma").</li>
            <li>
              <b>REL</b>: the relationship between the source concept 
              and the target concept to which it has been mapped (in 
              this case the relationship between the PDQ concept and 
              the NCIt concept to which it has been mapped).
              <ul>
                <li><b>RB</b>: indicates the source concept is broader 
                  than the target concept.</li>
                <li><b>RN</b>: indicates the source concept is narrower 
                  than the target concept.</li>
                <li><b>SY</b>: indicates the source concept and the 
                  target concept are synonymous.</li>
                <li><b>RQ</b>: indicates the source concept and the 
                  target concept are related and possibly synonymous.</li>

              of a mapping where a "1" is considered to be the highest 
              quality mapping and higher numbers indicate increasingly 
              lower quality mappings (the <b>map rank</b> is available 
              only for certain mapping data sets).</li>
            <li><b>Target</b>: the target terminology to which a source 
              terminology has been mapped (for a PDQ to NCIt mapping, 
              for example, the <b>target</b> will always be NCIt).</li>
            <li><b>Target Code</b>: the concept code of a target concept 
              to which a source concept has been mapped (for example, 
              the <b>target code</b> C3224 of the NCIt concept "Melanoma" 
              to which the PDQ concept "melanoma" has been mapped).</li>
            <li><b>Target Name</b>: the name of a target concept to 
              which a source concept has been mapped (for example, 
              the NCIt concept with the <b>target name</b> "Melanoma" 
              to which the PDQ concept "melanoma" has been mapped)..</li>
